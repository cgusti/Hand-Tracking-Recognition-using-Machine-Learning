# Hand-Tracking-Recognition-using-Machine-Learning

This repository contains code for Hand Tracking Recognition using Tensorflow keras's pretrained model for hand-sign tracking. This project utilizes a live web came to capture/tracks hand signs live and utilizes a pretrained model to project a label on the live footage. 

Instructions: 
Run HG_Detection.py
