# Hand-Tracking-Recognition-using-Machine-Learning

This repository contains a real-time Hand Gesture Recognizer using the MediaPipe framework and Tensorflow in OpenCV and Python. This project utilizes a live web came to capture/tracks hand signs live and utilizes a pretrained model to project a label on the live footage. 

Weâ€™ll first use MediaPipe to recognize the hand and the hand key points. MediaPipe performs the hand recognition algorithmreturns a total of 21 key points for each detected hand.

Instructions: 
Run HG_Detection.py
