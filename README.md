# Hand-Tracking-Recognition-using-Machine-Learning

This repository contains a real-time Hand Gesture Recognizer using the MediaPipe framework and Tensorflow in OpenCV and Python. OpenCV is a real-time Computer vision and image-processing framework built on C/C++. But we’ll use it on python via the OpenCV-python package. This project utilizes a live web came to capture/tracks hand signs live and utilizes a pretrained model to project a label on the live footage. 

We’ll first use MediaPipe to recognize the hand and the hand key points. MediaPipe returns a total of 21 key points for each detected hand.

Instructions: 
Run HG_Detection.py
